The problematic file might be empty, corrupted, or in a different format, causing issues downstream (though the immediate error suggests a problem before loading).\n",

    "### Step 3: Adjust the Problematic File’s Format\n",
    "To make the problematic file compatible with the working file, its content must match the expected format. Since the code processes the loaded data after `joblib.load` and the working file results in \"Loaded 1 motions,\" the pickle file likely contains a list of motion data entries or a dictionary with specific keys. Without the exact code or file contents, we’ll assume the working file contains a list of motion data dictionaries (a common format for such simulations).\n",

    "If the problematic file exists but has an incompatible format, you can adjust it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Problematic Data:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Transform to Match Working File:**\n",

    "\n",
    "   Example adjustment code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming working_data is a list of dictionaries\n",
    "if isinstance(working_data, list) and len(working_data) > 0:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Handle Code Expectations\n",
    "The error suggests `self._motion_data_load` is an empty list when indexed. The code might handle `motion_file` as follows:\n",

    "self._motion_data_load = joblib.load(self._motion_data_load[0])  # Load first file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file path is correct and the file exists, but `self._motion_data_load` becomes empty, the issue might be in how the path is processed before this line. To test this, modify your script to ensure the file is treated as a list:\n",

    "1. **Run the Code:** Execute this script from `/home/bbw/ASAPx1/` to check both files.\n",
    "2. **Fix Path Issues:** If the problematic file doesn’t exist, locate it or regenerate it using the same tool/process as the working file.\n",
    "3. **Compare Formats:** If both load, ensure `problematic_data` mimics `working_data` (e.g., a list with similar dictionary entries).\n",
    "4. **Test the Script:** Rerun your training command with the corrected/adjusted file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file exists and the format matches but the error persists, the issue lies in `motion_lib_base.py`’s logic, requiring a code modification to handle single file paths robustly. Let me know if you need further assistance after testing!"
