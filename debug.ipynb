Since `self._motion_data_load` is initially set to `self.m_cfg.motion_file`, which is a single file path string from your command, the code likely expects it to be a list of file paths.

    "\n",

    "Assuming the file exists (or after correcting the path), the next step is to load and compare the contents of both files. The working file successfully loads and results in a log message \"Loaded 1 motions,\" suggesting it contains motion data in a format the code expects—likely a list or dictionary with at least one motion entry. The problematic file might be empty, corrupted, or in a different format, causing issues downstream (though the immediate error suggests a problem before loading).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Adjust the Problematic File’s Format\n",
    "To make the problematic file compatible with the working file, its content must match the expected format. Since the code processes the loaded data after `joblib.load` and the working file results in \"Loaded 1 motions,\" the pickle file likely contains a list of motion data entries or a dictionary with specific keys. Without the exact code or file contents, we’ll assume the working file contains a list of motion data dictionaries (a common format for such simulations).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the problematic file exists but has an incompatible format, you can adjust it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Problematic Data:**\n",
    "   Use the inspection code above to determine its current format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transform to Match Working File:**\n",
    "   Suppose `working_data` is a list `[motion_dict]`, where `motion_dict` contains keys like `dof_pos`, `dof_vel`, etc., matching the robot’s 29 degrees of freedom. If `problematic_data` is different (e.g., a single dictionary or empty), reformat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example adjustment code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming working_data is a list of dictionaries\n",
    "if isinstance(working_data, list) and len(working_data) > 0:\n",
    "    expected_format = type(working_data[0])\n",
    "    print(f\"Expected entry type: {expected_format}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# If problematic_data exists but is not in the correct format\n",
    "if problematic_data is not None:\n",
    "    if not isinstance(problematic_data, list):\n",
    "        # Convert to a list with one entry\n",
    "        problematic_data = [problematic_data]\n",
    "    elif len(problematic_data) == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Problematic file is an empty list. It needs at least one motion entry.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Problematic data is a list. Check individual entries.\")\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot adjust: Problematic file could not be loaded.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- This is a generic fix. You need to ensure `problematic_data[0]` matches the structure of `working_data[0]` (e.g., same dictionary keys). If you have access to the motion data source, regenerate the problematic file using the same process that created the working file.\n",

    "1. **Run the Code:** Execute this script from `/home/bbw/ASAPx1/` to check both files.\n",
    "2. **Fix Path Issues:** If the problematic file doesn’t exist, locate it or regenerate it using the same tool/process as the working file.\n",
    "3. **Compare Formats:** If both load, ensure `problematic_data` mimics `working_data` (e.g., a list with similar dictionary entries).\n",
    "4. **Test the Script:** Rerun your training command with the corrected/adjusted file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file exists and the format matches but the error persists, the issue lies in `motion_lib_base.py`’s logic, requiring a code modification to handle single file paths robustly. Let me know if you need further assistance after testing!"
